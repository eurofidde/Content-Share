# Content Share (Image Uploader) V0.3

V0.3 Changes (Work in progress):
- Rebuilt from scratch.
- New design and feel.
- Removed custom domain function.
- Added ability to also upload videos.
- Renamed to content share (no longer makes sense to call it an image uploader).
- Messages will now display confirming if an action (like uploading a file) has been done successfully.

Todo:
- Add shortlink support.
- Add the ability to see what type of file an upload is on the uploads page.
- Add full video support.

Todo (Future Features):
- Add the ability to view a image/video from directly within the the uploads page instead of opening a new tab.
- Add the ability for shortcodes to use a seperate domain/record (the idea behind this is that you can use a seperate smaller domain for shortcodes if the domain/record being uses is really long).


Known Bugs:
1. Dragleave isn't working when dragging file from out of chrome window
2. Content thats also in the same window (i.e <img> and <a> tags) are also triggering drag and drop.

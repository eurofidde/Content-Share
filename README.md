# Content Share (Image Uploader) V0.3

V0.3 Changes (Work in progress):
- Rebuilt from scratch.
- New design and feel.
- Removed custom domain function.
- Added ability to also upload videos.
- Renamed to content share (no longer makes sense to call it an image uploader).
- Messages will now display confirming if an action (like uploading a file) has been done successfully.


Known Bugs:
1. Dragleave isn't working when dragging file from out of chrome window
2. Content thats also in the same window (i.e <img> and <a> tags) are also triggering drag and drop.
